			<h3>Personal Statement</h3>
			<p> A marketing and management student at Victoria University of Wellington. Seeking a part
				time position to help develop skills needed for entering into a successful marketing career.
				Through my experience working in a retail environment I have obtained techniques that
				help me be a hard working, conscientious worker and I wish to apply these techniques to a
				new field.

		<h3>Work Experience</h3>
			<div>
				<h4 class="organisationWE">Whitcoulls Johnsonville - Supervisor <span class="date">(2015 - <span class="current">Current</span> )<span></h4>
				<p>As a supervisor at Whitcoulls I was given a number of responsibilities that provided me
					with useful skills, Including the ability to manage small numbers of staff and managing
					difficult customers. This often involved attempting to resolve customer complaints and
					attempting to keep customers happy. Occasionally I would also take on roles to help
					manage stock, such as stock taking, receipting in stock and internal transferring. Lastly
					the main responsibility I held was the opening and closing of the store, which meant
					counting and preparing tills, securely (un)locking the store and ensuring the store is left in
					a presentable state.</p>

				<h4 class="organisationWE"><span id="AGDALink"><a href="angelaGoodallDanceAcademy/angelaGoodallTransitionPage.html">Angela Goodall Dance Academy - Media Design <span class="date">(2015)</span> </a></span></h4>
				<p> In order to help Angela Goodall relaunch her dance academy I was asked to design a
					series of promotional pieces to be distributed. To do this an HTML website was made
					to provide customers basic information (including timetable, street address and contact
					methods). To accompany this a variety of flyers, posters and newspaper adverts</p>

				<h4 class="organisationWE">Whitcoulls Johnsonville - Sales Person <span class="date">(2013 - 2015)</span></h4>
				<p>As a salesperson many things were expected of us. One such thing was that customers
					took priority over anything else, as such we were taught to provide customers with the
					best service we could, often times this meant looking products up for them (using a database),
					personally selling particular products and/or providing recommendations. This also
					came along with training on a point of sale service. Other such responsibilities we held as
					sales people were often implementing head office actions (such as price changes, classification
					changes and promotions). We also did the typically housekeeping jobs such as putting
					stock out and cleaning up mess.</p>
