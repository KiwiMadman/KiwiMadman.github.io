<h2>About Us</h2>
	<h3>Angela Goodall</h3>
	My name is Angela Goodall and I am teach under the New Zealand Academy of Modern Dance (NZAMD), to provide my dancing students with examination syllabi in Jazz,Tap, Ballet, Hip-Hop, Contemporary and Pre School Dance.</p>
<p>The NZAMD is a certified organisation who support dance teachers throughout NZ. I am a registered dance teacher of this organisation.</p>
 <p>I began dancing in Wellington when I was 6 years old with the Cathrine Aslin School of Dance performing in end of year concerts, recitals and also spending many years competing in dance competions in the lower North Island. I continued my love of stage and dance by performing in many local amateur theatre plays and musicals.</p>
          <p>I started the Angela Goodall Dance Academy in 2001 under the guidance
          of Cathrine Aslin MNZM who mentored and supported the studio for   
          many years until her passing in 2008.</p>
<p>I have a Diploma in ECE Education which allows me to better understand children's learning styles, therefore all students will be in a positive, stimulating and fun dance environment.  </p>
          
          <p>I look forward to getting to know your child and welcome your family to                  
          the Angela Goodall Dance Academy.</p>
